        Your favorite sushi starter stars a gut-friendly ingredient. <br>“Miso is a fermented condiment made from soybeans and contains probiotics that support good gut health,” says Iu.<br>

        <br>It is also rich in choline and B vitamins, which both support cognitive function, and vitamin K, which aids in blood clotting.<br>Try thinking beyond soup<br> Miso is great as a marinade base for meat or fish, or whisked into a dressing to drizzle over veggies.

            You know that tofu is a plant-based protein featured in plenty of East Asian recipes, but seitan is another meat alternative with roots in China and Japan, says Chou.

            “Seitan is made from wheat gluten, a plant-based protein, and was developed by Buddhist monks in China and Japan,” Chou explains.<br> “It has a wonderful meaty texture and is high in protein and iron.” Seitan is super versatile, so treat it as you would any other meat or plant-based alternative.

            This leafy green is technically a type of Chinese cabbage, mild in flavor with a tender yet crunchy center and vibrant, slightly bitter leaves.<br> And besides being tasty, it is also brimming with vitamins C and E and beta-carotene (all inflammation fighters), as well as fiber, which supports good digestion and keeps you full, says Iu.

            “A healthy and delicious way to prepare bok choy is to sauté it in a pan with garlic and ginger until just wilted.<br>
             Drizzle with sesame oil and soy sauce,” Iu suggests.
